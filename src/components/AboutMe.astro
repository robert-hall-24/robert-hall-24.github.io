        <div class="pt-6 text-white">
            <p class="text-left">I am Robert Hall, a Full Stack Software Developer with a background in IT Support. Recently, I completed my training at Dev Academy Aotearoa, where I achieved MVP status as a Product Owner in team projects. This experience allowed me to showcase my leadership and collaborative skills while gaining hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development. I am passionate about learning new technologies and thrive in collaborative settings, adapting easily to various roles within a development team. Currently, I am exploring new opportunities in the software industry.
            <br/>
            <br/>

                My technical skills span a wide range, including proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React for front-end development, and Node.js, Express, SQLite3, and Knex for back-end development. I am well-versed in using Tailwind CSS for styling and have experience with tools such as Git, Agile practices, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and pair programming. In my previous roles as an IT System Analyst at Flux Federation, I streamlined support processes and managed internal applications, and as an IT Support Specialist at Xero, I handled support channels and developed support documentation. My diverse skill set, combined with my passion for technology and teamwork, makes me a valuable asset to any development team.</p>
